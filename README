GUIDE:
1) Please first run beforeEclipse.sh script that is found 
inside the main project folder to create all neccesarry folders 
for the input inside HDFS.

2) Import the project in Eclipse and press RUN for Indexer class.

3) Please run the afterEclipse.sh for viewing the data in terminal.
It copies the data inside the local folder from HDFS and shows the two 
phases.

IF anything goes wrong ,please let me know.The procedure should work fine 
with no errors! There is a results.png that shows how results should be printed 
after running afterEclipse.sh script.

Summary: 
1)chmod 755 beforeEclipse.sh
2)./beforeEclipse
3)Eclipse -> import ->run INDEXER class
4)chmod 755 afterEclipse.sh
5)./afterEclipse

Modular Design:
For the two phases I used four classes two for mappers and two for reducers.
Each class is named properly. 
All four classes are being run throught an indexer as the example in the class.

Documentation:
Comments are added inside the project for explaning the procedure.

Thank you!
